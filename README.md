# My Resume

This repository contains my professional resume written in LaTeX. It serves as both my personal resume and an example of a DevOps Engineer's technical resume. Feel free to use this template for your own resume.
Feel free to adapt this template to your specific requirements. If you need further assistance or have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask!

## Features

- **LaTeX Format**: The resume is written in LaTeX, making it easy to maintain and customize.
- **GitHub Actions**: A GitHub Action is set up to automatically generate a new version of the resume PDF whenever you update the `.tex` file.
